Csound API. Using generated code with another languages
==================================================================

The cool thing about Csound is that it's not only a text to audio converter.
It's also a C-library! Also it has bindings to many languages! 
Python, Java, Clojure, Lua, Clojure, Csharp,  C++, racket, VB!

We can create audio engine with Haskell and then we can 
wrap it in the UI written in some another language!
Let's look at how it can be done.
