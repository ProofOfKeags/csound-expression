GENfarey — Fills a table with the Farey Sequence Fn of the integer n.
GENwave — Generates a compactly supported wavelet function.
GEN25 — Construct functions from segments of exponential curves in breakpoint fashion.
GEN27 — Construct functions from segments of straight lines in breakpoint fashion.


----------------------
-- hard to implement within the urrent model

GEN15 — Creates two tables of stored polynomial functions.
